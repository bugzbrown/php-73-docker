# PHP 73 DOCKER

This is a starter repository for a simple docker compose that creates a LAMP Stack for local development.

> **THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND WILL NOT WORK**

It is based on this repository: https://github.com/sprintcube/docker-compose-lamp.git and adjusted to suit my workflow and organization for local projects.

## REQUIREMENTS

    - nodejs 10+
    - docker


## How to and Why

The idea behind this is to quickly get up and running with a local environment.

- Clone the repository
- cd into the directory and run:

```bash
yarn install
```

or if you use NPM

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the setup command:

```bash
yarn setup
```

or

```bash
npm run setup
```

Answer the prompts and be happy.
